# website-program
 
Hi! I made my new website development that I observe the programming to improve the website. Working on frontend and backend.

Process to study JS, it's definitely challenge and link to HTML and CSS. I have a thought of JSC is advancing design something colorful, movements, time, etc is more useful.

So on, I continue to work it while walking my journey of programming.

Thanks!
